Requirements:
- TensorFLow 2.0
- cudatoolkit 10.0
- cudnn 7.6 
- opencv 3.4 


Execution Steps:

1. Download the original weights, "yolov3.weights", from:
https://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolov3.weights
to the folder weights.

2. Execute the convert_weights.py:

   python convert_weights.py

   Before testing, make sure that the weights have been converted to TF2 format.
   The converted weights save in the weights folder.

3. For image:

   python image.py

4. For video/cam:

   python video.py
